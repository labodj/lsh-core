 * @brief   ETL compile-time profile used by lsh-core.
 * @details This file provides the default ETL policy used by `lsh-core` on the
 *          supported Arduino/PlatformIO targets. ETL still auto-detects the
 *          active compiler and language support through `etl/profiles/auto.h`.
 *
 *          Advanced consumers that need a different ETL setup may define
 *          `LSH_ETL_PROFILE_OVERRIDE_HEADER` to a quoted header name through
 *          their build flags. That header is included last, so it may `#undef`
 *          and redefine any of the defaults below.
