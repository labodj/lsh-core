 * @brief   Example project-local ETL override hook for the bundled lsh-core example.
 * @details This header mirrors the historical `lsh-core` ETL policy and
 *          shows where a consumer project can keep toolchain-specific ETL
 *          choices without editing the library copy of `etl_profile.h`.
